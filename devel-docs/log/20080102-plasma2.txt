Development log for "weskaggs" branch.

2008-01-02:   Plasma2 filter.

One of the points that the usability team has made is that Gimp needs
a more complete set of noise- or texture-generating plug-ins.  Toward
that end, I am adding a massively rewritten version of "plasma",
created a few years ago by David Necas (aka Yeti).  It is well
written, and adds considerable functionality, which is all easily
discoverable via the preview.  I have formatted the code according to
Gimp coding style, and replaced all of the deprecated functionality.

Because this essentially replaces the orignal "plasma", I am removing
the old version from the menu, but leaving it in the PDB since it is
likely to be used by a substantial number of scripts.
