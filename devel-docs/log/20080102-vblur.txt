Development log for "weskaggs" branch.

2008-01-02:  Variable blur filter.

I'm going to add a few filters that I believe form part of the basic
"toolkit" that should be available to all users.  This is the first.
It does a simple blur, but with an intensity at each point controlled
by a "map" drawable.  This plug-in was written several years ago, and
an earlier version is available in the registry.  I have updated it
and added a preview.
