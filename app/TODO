convert to using gtk+
remove traces of autodialog
remove traces of action areas
remove use of mem chunks from memutils.[ch]
remove use of xmalloc and xfree (use g_malloc and g_free instead)

Canvas validator routines

  this needs to be done since it drives the compositing of
  multilayered gimages


8 bitness

  HALF_WAY

  channel_value return 0-255, this gets used a lot.  what semantics do we
  want?


indexed color handling

  the current code has dropped support for converting indexed to RGB via
  gimage->cmap.  we should look at adding this back sometime.


drawable creation

  provide alternate constructors that accept a prebuilt Canvas instead of
  parameters for building one.

  it darkens the area being convolved
  multiply/separate alpha for images with alpha channel

do histogram_tool
  ????

fix iscissors
  lots of work
