Issues

IMAGE_RENDER_C_1_cw 
The tilebuf (where the display pixels get built) is hard coded
to handle the max byte size right now.
IMAGE_RENDER_C_2_cw
Temporary precision variable for the switch below. 
IMAGE_RENDER_C_3_cw
Temporary switch -- uncomment the line once canvas is hooked up.
IMAGE_RENDER_C_4_cw
Change all render_image_tile_fault s to render_image_canvas_fault s
once canvas s are hooked up everywhere.
IMAGE_RENDER_C_5_cw
Change the info->src_tiles to info->src_canvas once Canvas * is
returned from gimage_projection().
IMAGE_RENDER_C_6_cw
May want to rewrite render_image_canvas_faults to use
pixelarea_copy_row (which faults automatically) instead
of doing the faulting ourselves here.


PIXELAREA_C_1_cw
Not sure what to do with the subsample parameter here. scale_area
does use this value. 
PIXELAREA_C_2_cw
Same as above .. subsample not used.


PAINT_CORE_16_C_1_cw
Commented out the grab pointer for debuggging
