	Merged 24493-24499 from trunk

2007-12-31  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	This is a set of changes aimed at making the "linking"
	function usable as a vector-selection.  A new tool is
	added, derived from the existing alignment tool, that
	allows items to be linked by clicking on them or enclosing
	them in a rubber-band box.  The "align" and "distribute" 
	functions are removed from the alignment tool, and made 
	accessible via dialogs in the "image" submenu -- they now 
	act on the set of linked items rather than a temporary list 
	maintained by the align tool.

	A set of changes enabling gimp to work properly without a 
	toolbox	menu.  As suggested by the usability team, when gimp 
	is opened without an image, a "scratch" image is created, from
	the splash image, to hold the menus.  The scratch image
	is automatically deleted if any other image is created.  If
	the last open image is closed, a new scratch image is created.
	DND to the scratch image causes a new image to be created.

	* configure.in:  change default to disable toolbox menu.

	* devel-docs/log: new directory

	* devel-docs/log/20071231-scratch.txt: more detailed explanation
	of changes made in this commit.
	
	* app/file/file-open.[ch]:  add function to create scratch image
	and display.

	* app/app.c: if no files specified, create a scratch image
	on startup.
	
	* app/core/gimpimage.[ch]: add "scratch" boolean.
	
	* app/core/gimp-gui.[ch] (gimp_create_scratch_display): new
	function.
	
	* app/core/gimp.[ch]:  add "exiting" boolean, so we can tell
	that we don't need a new scratch image.

	* app/actions/image-actions.c
	* app/actions/layers-actions.c
	* app/actions/view-actions.c
	* app/actions/file-actions.c

	* app/display/gimpdisplay.c: create or delete scratch images
	as necessary.
	
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-title.c: use "GIMP" as title
	for a scratch image.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-dnd.c
	* app/widgets/gimptoolbox-dnd.[ch]: send dnd's onto a scratch
	image to the toolbox instead.
