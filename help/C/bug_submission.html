>    Bug submission is an important aspect of many Open Source projects,
    and submitting bugs correctly increases the chances of the core
    development team finding and fixing any problems that may arise.
    Of important note is the realization that it may not be the
    <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GIMP</SPAN
> causing your particular problem,
    thus, one can understand the need for clear, concise, and accurate
    submissions to the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GIMP</SPAN
> developers.

NAME="BUGSUBMISSIONHOW"
>How to collect the information</A
></H2
><P
>      As outlined, it is preferred if you can supply a certain level of
      system information in your bug submissions. You may well be
      wondering what, or indeed how, to get this all important
      information.
    </P
><P
>      The first piece of information that is important is the version
      of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GIMP</SPAN
> that you are running. This can
      be found by clicking <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Help</SPAN
> 
      <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>About</SPAN
>. As you can imagine, if the
      problem you are
      submitting has already been fixed in a more current version of
      the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GIMP</SPAN
> than what you are using &mdash;
      the solution will be very straight forward.  It is also helpful
      to know where your copy of the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GIMP</SPAN
>
      originated from. Was it included with your distribution? Did you
      copy it off a magazine CD? Did you download the .rpms or the
      .debs? This will help locate problems caused by external
      influences, such as incorrect library versions.  Of equal
      importance is the version of <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>GTK</SPAN
> currently in
      use on your system. The easiest way to find this information is
      to start a terminal window (Xterm, Eterm, konsole, etc), and run
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>gtk-config --version</B
>. This will output your
      <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>GTK</SPAN
> version to the terminal.
    </P
><P
>      Another number that might help is your
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>XFree86</SPAN
> version. This can be a little
      more difficult to find out. If you use a Linux distribution that
      uses a package management system such as RedHat, Mandrake,
      Debian, CorelLinux, or one of the many others, you will find the
      package tools invaluable in discovering application version
      numbers.  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>XFree86</SPAN
> is the windowing
      system that allows <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Window Managers</SPAN
> to
      display such things as windows, title bars, docks, panels, and
      all the other prettiness you may see on your screen. If you are
      using <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Windows</SPAN
>, this does not apply.
    </P
><P
>      If you have a problem related to windowing (such as dialogs not
      showing, or the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GIMP</SPAN
> suddenly
      disappearing without apparent error) or display-oriented
      strangeness, it would be helpful to know which window manager
      you are using. Another question that could be asked is
      whether <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>GNOME</SPAN
> or <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>KDE</SPAN
> (if
      either) is being used.
    </P
><P
>      Another useful tidbit of information that is valuable for
      diagnosis is stating exactly what it is that has caused the
      problem. Simply saying, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"The foo plug-in doesn't
      work."</SPAN
> is not very helpful. Try to be as explicit as
      possible, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"When I clicked 'foo-button' in the 'bar-plugin'
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GIMP</SPAN
> told me that such and such
      didn't work."</SPAN
>. If the developers don't know exactly
      which part of the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GIMP</SPAN
> caused the
      error, or problem you are referring to, they can't really help
      you.
    </P
><P
>      Now that you have gathered all of the information needed for an
      accurate bug submission, let's move on to actually submitting
      the report.

			You will have to set up a user account and then will be able to

    </P
><P
>      Now that you've submitted a bug report that's concise,
      insightful, and just a little daring, what now? It would be
      unreasonable to expect the developers to respond to every report
      in person, but know that your report has been noted, and, if it
      can be reproduced, it will be fixed. Bugs that are not actual bugs
      (problems that are not related to code) should be answered for
      you if someone else can reproduce it, or has had the same
      problem before.
