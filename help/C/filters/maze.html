>    The <SPAN

> filter fills the active
    selection or layer with a maze. Every square in the maze
    is accessible from every other, if you can find the right
    path. There are no loops. Features include a choice of
    maze generation algorithms (Prim's Algorithm or
    depth-first), tileable mazes, and non-rectangular shaped
    mazes.

    of the wall and passage blocks (currently there is no support for
    making the two different sizes). The
    <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>pieces</SPAN
> selectors are provided as
    semi-intelligent aides to choosing a proper size, taking into
    account the tileable mode and image size. They will only choose
    sizes that divide more or less evenly into the image size, an even
    or odd number of times, depending on whether the maze is to be
    tileable or not. However, in the end, it is the width and height
    settings which are used to produce the maze, so results may not
    exactly match the <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>pieces</SPAN
> setting if you did
    something weird to it.

>    The maze plug-in can generate tileable mazes; that is, make passages
    going off the right (or bottom) edge wrap around and be continued on
    the left (or top). This is useful for wallpapering and the like.
  </P
><P
>    This places some constraints on the passage size. There must be an
    even number of divisions, and the passage size should divide evenly
    into the image size. Note that non-tileable mazes have an odd
    number of divisions. Maze silently enforces this rule.
  </P
><P
>    The <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>random seed</SPAN
> used to generate the maze. Use
    the same seed with the same maze size and wall width, and you'll end
    up with the same maze. Pressing the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Time</SPAN
>
    button will use the current time as the random seed.
  </P
><P
>    The plug-in knows two different ways to make mazes: the
    <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>depth-first</SPAN
> method and <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Prim's
    algorithm</SPAN
>. Depth-first is <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>much</I
>
    faster than Prim's algorithm, and generally produces long, twisty
    passages. Prim's algorithm is typically characterized by many very
    short passages with frequent branches.
  </P
><P
>    If there is an active selection, maze will keep non-selected
    portions of the layer as wall and create maze passages within the
    selection. If the selection is disjointed, the plug-in will draw as
    many mazes as needed to fill all portions of the selection.
