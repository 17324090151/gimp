>    The Image Window is by default bordered at the top and left by a ruler
    that is measured in pixels at one hundred pixel intervals, or in the unit
    selected in the
    <A
HREF="../dialogs/preferences/interface.html"
>      Preferences Dialog
    </A
>.
    There is a small black arrow located on each of the rulers that indicates
    the location of the cursor within the Image Window. There is also a
    numeric position indicator located at the lower left of the window. The
    numeric representation is shown as an X coordinate and a Y coordinate in
    pixels or the current image unit.
  </P

>    Across the lower of the Image Window is the Statusbar. The Statusbar
    shows not only the X/Y pointer coordinates as described above, but also
    located to the right of the pointer location is the filename and
    information area, and further still to the right, the plugin progress
    indicator. The filename area shows information regarding color depth,
    zoom level, and image format. The amount and type of information shown
    here can be configured in the
    <A
HREF="../dialogs/preferences/interface.html"
>      Preferences Dialog
    </A
>.
    The progress indicator shows a completion bar for any plugin that might
    be used on the image. Any activity can be cancelled by clicking the
    <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Cancel</SPAN
> button before the plugin completes.

    which show a

ALT="red square"
></IMG
></SPAN
></SPAN
> invokes the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Quick Mask"</SPAN
>.
    This adds an extra channel which can be edited to make complex
    selections. Once the mask has been satisfactorily modified, clicking the
    <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>dotted square</SPAN
> will convert the mask into a
    standard selection. The color and opacity of the mask can be configured
    by <SPAN

    Clicking and holding this button will show a small preview of the whole
    image. This is particularly useful when working at very high zoom levels
    and require visual information regarding changes made that may affect the
    overall image. Moving within this box will move the picture to the
    desired location and remain there after the button is lifted.
