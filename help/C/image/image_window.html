>    By default, the image window is bordered at the top and left by a
    ruler which is measured in pixels at 100 pixel intervals or in the
    unit you choose in the <A
HREF="../dialogs/preferences/interface.html"
> preferences
    dialog</A
>. There is an arrow on each ruler which show the
    vertical and horizontal position of the cursor when your pointer
    is within the window. The position of the cursor can also be seen
    in figures at the bottom left corner of the window if turned on.
    This is in the format X direction, Y direction and is in pixels or
    the image's unit.

>    Also at the bottom of the image window (on the
    <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Statusbar</SPAN
>) is the filename and other
    information about the image such as the zoom level. This is also
    displayed as the title to the window. The information displayed
    can be configured in <A
HREF="../dialogs/preferences/interface.html"
>    <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Preferences</SPAN
> </A
> (<SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Image
    Windows</SPAN
>,  <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Image Title Format</SPAN

    Next to this is a section which displays a progress bar when an
    operation will take a long time. That action can be aborted by
    clicking the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Cancel</SPAN
> button next to it.
  </P
><P

    which shows a 
    <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
><SPAN
CLASS="INLINEMEDIAOBJECT"
><IMG
SRC="../../images/dotted_square.png"
ALT="dotted square"
></IMG
></SPAN
></SPAN
>, and the other a 
    <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>red square</SPAN
>. Clicking the 
    <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
><SPAN
CLASS="INLINEMEDIAOBJECT"
><IMG
SRC="../../images/red_square.png"
ALT="red square"
></IMG
></SPAN
></SPAN
> invokes the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Quick
    Mask"</SPAN
>. This adds an extra channel which can be edited to make
    complex selections. Once the mask has been edited to your
    satisfaction, click the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>dotted square</SPAN
> to
    convert it into a standard selection. The color and opacity of the
    mask can be configured by <SPAN
CLASS="MOUSEBUTTON"
>double-clicking</SPAN
>
    either button.
  </P
><P
>    The final feature of the image window is the 
    <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
><SPAN
CLASS="INLINEMEDIAOBJECT"
><IMG
SRC="../../images/preview_box.png"
></IMG
></SPAN
></SPAN
>. 
    Clicking and holding this button will show a small preview of the
    whole image. This is particularly useful when you are working at
    very high zoom levels and want to see how your changes affect the
    overall image. Moving within this box will move the picture to
    the desired location and remain there after the button is lifted.
  </P
><P
>    Many of these features can be configured, or turned on and off 
    in <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Preferences</SPAN
> <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Image
    Windows</SPAN
>, so you may need to make some changes 
    to see all the features.
